It is not required to write software in metaL from scratch. The more convenient and easy way is *integrating homoiconic runtime into any existing software* system gently step by step. It is some sort of refactoring when you wrap tiny pieces of code into frames, which adds the first reflection, then the ability to make scripting commands, and finally, provide full support for methods of object graph programming in `metaL` in a dynamic manner. Making such metaL injection which I call **galvanization**, you are adding tiny layers of `metaL` above existing software which stays under active use in production.
